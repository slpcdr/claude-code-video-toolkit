## 2025-12-10

### Changed
- **Consolidated tracking files** - Simplified from 4 files to 3:
  - `ROADMAP.md` - What we're building (removed duplicate "Next Actions" and "In Progress" sections)
  - `BACKLOG.md` - What we might build (removed all implemented items, now only future ideas)
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - What we built (historical record)
  - Removed `FEEDBACK.md` - Evolution principles moved to `docs/contributing.md`
- Created `docs/contributing.md` with evolution principles and contribution workflow

### Fixed
- **Slash commands not loading** - Renamed `/skill` to `/skills` to avoid conflict with built-in `Skill` tool. The naming collision was silently preventing ALL custom commands from loading. Bug reported to Anthropic.

### Removed
- **`/review` command** - Clashed with Claude Code's built-in PR review command. Scene-by-scene review will be integrated into `/video` resume flow instead.

### Added

  - Safe to contribute without exposing project content
- **New `examples/` directory** for shareable showcase projects
  - Configs, scripts, and docs are tracked
