# ElevenLabs Audio Generation

ElevenLabs provides AI-powered audio generation including text-to-speech, sound effects, and music. Requires API key as `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`.

## Setup

```bash
pip install elevenlabs python-dotenv
```

Store API key in `.env`:
```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Text-to-Speech (Voiceover)

```python
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
from elevenlabs import save, VoiceSettings
import os

client = ElevenLabs(api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"))

audio = client.text_to_speech.convert(
    text="Welcome to my video!",
    voice_id="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",  # George - warm narrator
    model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
    voice_settings=VoiceSettings(
        stability=0.5,        # 0-1: Lower = more expressive
        similarity_boost=0.75,
        style=0.5,
        speed=1.0
    )
)
save(audio, "voiceover.mp3")
```

**Models:**
- `eleven_flash_v2_5` - Ultra-low latency (~75ms)
- `eleven_multilingual_v2` - Highest quality, 32 languages
- `eleven_turbo_v2_5` - Balanced quality/speed

**Popular Voices:**
- George: `JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb` (warm narrator)
- Rachel: `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` (clear female)
- Adam: `pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB` (professional male)

List all voices: `client.voices.get_all()`

## Voice Cloning

Clone your own voice for personalized voiceovers.

### Instant Voice Clone (1-2 min audio, instant)

```python
# Files must be opened as binary file handles, not paths
with open("sample.mp3", "rb") as f:
    voice = client.voices.ivc.create(
        name="My Voice",
        files=[f],
        remove_background_noise=True
    )

print(f"Voice ID: {voice.voice_id}")  # Save this for reuse

# Use cloned voice
audio = client.text_to_speech.convert(
    text="This is my cloned voice!",
    voice_id=voice.voice_id,
    model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2"
)
```

**Important:**
- Use `client.voices.ivc.create()` (not `client.voices.clone()`)
- Pass file handles opened in binary mode (`"rb"`), not file paths
- Convert m4a to mp3 first if needed: `ffmpeg -i input.m4a -codec:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 2 output.mp3`
- Multiple samples (2-3 clips) improve voice accuracy
- Save the voice ID for reuse to avoid creating new clones each run

**Recording tips:** Quiet room, 1-2 min total (longer is better), consistent tone, USB mic or phone sufficient.

**Voice Settings for natural speech:**
- `stability`: 0.75-0.85 (higher = more consistent, fewer odd inflections)
- `similarity_boost`: 0.9-0.95 (higher = closer to original voice)
- `style`: 0.0-0.1 (lower = more neutral, less "character")
- `speed`: 1.0 (adjust if timing doesn't match video)

**Script pauses:** Use `<break time="1.0s" />` tags in script text to add pauses between sections.

### Professional Voice Clone (30+ min audio, 3-6 hours training)

Requires Creator plan+. Higher fidelity, requires voice verification. See [reference.md](reference.md) for full PVC workflow.

## Sound Effects

Generate sound effects from text descriptions (max 22 seconds).

```python
result = client.text_to_sound_effects.convert(
    text="Thunder rumbling followed by heavy rain",
    duration_seconds=10,
    prompt_influence=0.3  # 0-1: How strictly to follow prompt
)

with open("thunder.mp3", "wb") as f:
    for chunk in result:
        f.write(chunk)
```

**Prompt tips:** Be specific - "Heavy footsteps on wooden floorboards, slow and deliberate, with creaking"

## Music Generation (Eleven Music)

Generate studio-grade music (10 seconds to 5 minutes).

```python
result = client.music.compose(
    prompt="Upbeat indie rock, catchy guitar riff, energetic drums, travel vlog",
    music_length_ms=60000,  # 60 seconds
    force_instrumental=True
)

with open("background_music.mp3", "wb") as f:
    for chunk in result:
        f.write(chunk)
```

**Important:** Use `client.music.compose()` (not `client.music.generate()`)

**Prompt structure:** Include genre, mood, instruments, tempo, use case.

## Remotion Integration

Save audio to `public/` folder for Remotion projects:

```python
save(audio, "public/audio/voiceover.mp3")
```

Then in Remotion:
```tsx
import { Audio, staticFile } from 'remotion';

<Audio src={staticFile('audio/voiceover.mp3')} />
```
