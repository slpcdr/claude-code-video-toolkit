# Contributing to antigravity-video-toolkit

This toolkit is designed to grow through use. Every interaction is an opportunity to improve.

## How to Contribute

### Local Users (working with Google Antigravity)

1. **Tell Antigravity** - Just say "I have feedback" or "this could be better"
2. **Antigravity captures it** - Ideas go to `_internal/BACKLOG.md`, bugs get fixed
3. **Patterns emerge** - Common needs become new features
4. **Submit upstream** - `gh pr create` to share with others

### Remote Contributors (via GitHub)

- **Issues**: [github.com/digitalsamba/antigravity-video-toolkit/issues](https://github.com/digitalsamba/antigravity-video-toolkit/issues)
  - Bug reports, feature requests, questions
- **Pull Requests**: Fork, improve, submit PR
  - New templates, skills, commands
  - Documentation improvements
  - Bug fixes

## Evolution Principles

### Commands Evolve
Commands start simple and grow based on real usage:
- `/video` started as `/new-sprint-video`, expanded to multi-template, multi-session
- `/brand` merged creation and listing into one entry point
- Patterns that work get documented; patterns that don't get removed

### Skills Mature
Skills progress through maturity levels:
- **draft** → **beta** → **stable**
- Each real-world use validates or improves the skill
- Reference docs grow from actual questions and edge cases

### Templates Generalize
Templates extract patterns from projects:
- Build a project, notice reusable patterns
- Extract to template, parameterize the specifics
- Share components via `lib/` when used across templates

### The Toolkit Learns
Every session teaches the toolkit something:
- What workflows are awkward? → Improve commands
- What questions keep coming up? → Add to skill docs
- What's missing? → Add to `_internal/BACKLOG.md`
